# nSpired Server
## Create goals. Meet them. Share your wins.

---

**nSpired** was created to offer a platform specifically to meeting goals independently, while connecting and sharing with others who want to achieve the same.  

Science has proven time and time again that by surrounding yourself with others who have the same goals as you, you:  
- are held accountable to a new standard  
- can motivate others with your progress  
- can gain insight from others who are further along in their progress  
- may discover new goals that you would like to meet along the way
